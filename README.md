# OneLine
OneLine is an abstraction standardized framework. 

OneLine is still under heavy development and testing. 

It will be completed with documentation to use very soon.

What is OneLine goal and how this framework differs from the others frameworks?

OneLine tries to abstract the development efforts by simply going from general and specific applications behaviors using generic interfaces and applying the appropriate implementations with actions handlers that can be listened to perform derived actions and that can be classified as a general or particular case use.
